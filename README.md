# EasyBake-UI
EasyBake is a library of ready-to-go components that you can use in your next project. They are client-side rendered and can be easily customised to fit your needs.
## What's inside
Currently, the library is comprised of two components, an image carousel and a hero section slider but more are on the way! It's built with plain **HTML5/CSS/JS** and uses **GSAP** to power it's UI animations. You can create as many instances of a component as you want and take advantage of it's:

- Smooth animation 💨
- Ton of customisation 🔧
- Lightweight size ⚖️
- Responsive design 📏
